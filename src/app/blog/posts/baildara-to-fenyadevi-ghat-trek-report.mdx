Moving westward, we entered the Baildara Trail, characterized by dense karvi shrubs and unmarked paths. The trail descended sharply to Kalakrai Village, where we paused for a short break.

From Kalakrai, the route transitioned to the Fenyadevi Ghat Trail, featuring steep ascents, dramatic rock formations, and ancient stone relics. The final stretch involved navigating narrow footpaths back to Vitthalvadi Village, concluding the trek.
